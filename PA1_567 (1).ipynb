        "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It doesn't learn parameters or rules like other methods, but instead predicts outputs based on the similarity of inputs. In classification, a new instance is assigned the most common class among its 'K' closest instances from the training data. In regression, it's assigned the average value of the 'K' nearest instances. The choice of 'K' and proper scaling of input features are crucial for optimal results."
